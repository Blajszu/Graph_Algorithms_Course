# Graph Algorithms Labs â€“ AGH University  

This repository contains implementations of graph algorithms from the *Graph Algorithms* course at AGH University of Science and Technology (Computer Science). Each folder corresponds to a separate lab, including problem descriptions, algorithm implementations, and test cases. The repository provides structured materials for learning and practicing key graph algorithms.

## Requirements  

This repository requires Python and the `networkx` library for graph processing. To install dependencies, use:  

```bash
pip install networkx
```

## Usage  

First, clone the repository and navigate to the desired lab directory:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name/Lab1  # Change Lab1 to the desired folder
```

Each lab folder contains a Python script implementing the required algorithm, along with test cases. Run the appropriate script inside the chosen directory.  

This repository serves as a reference for understanding and implementing various graph algorithms.
